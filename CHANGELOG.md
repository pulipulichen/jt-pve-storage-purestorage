## [1.1.4] - 2026-04-09

### Six more bugs found by an internal deep audit after 1.1.3

Applied the "sibling pattern" audit rule (every bug fix triggers a
codebase-wide search for the same anti-pattern) to every cleanup path,
`/sys/block` access, and API version-divergence point in the codebase.
**Recommended over 1.1.3** — the API 1.x normalisation issue is HIGH
severity for any user on Pure REST API 1.x.

#### Fixed
- **[HIGH] `volume_get_connections()` did not normalise the API 1.x
  response shape.** Pure REST 1.x returns
  `[{ host => "h1", lun => 1, name => "myvol" }, ...]` where the
  `name` field is the **volume** name, not the host name. The 2.x
  branch was already normalised to `{ name => "<host>" }`. Every
  caller (`free_image`, `_disconnect_from_all_hosts`,
  `_backup_vm_config`, `_cleanup_orphaned_temp_clones`,
  `_cleanup_temp_snap_clone`, `alloc_image` orphan-cleanup) iterated
  `$conn->{name}`, which on 1.x returned the **volume** name. The
  subsequent `volume_disconnect_host($vol, $conn->{name})` therefore
  passed the volume name as the host argument, which silently fails
  inside an `eval`. **Result on API 1.x: every disconnect call was a
  no-op, leaving orphaned host connections forever, and every
  `volume_delete` cleanup hit the Bug E ghost-LUN failure mode.**
  Fixed by normalising the API 1.x branch in
  `volume_get_connections()` to the same `[{ name => "<host>" }]`
  shape, with fallback to `host_name` and `name` fields.
- **[HIGH] `path()` temp clone connect-failure had two bugs in one
  sequence**: (a) Bug E pattern — `volume_delete($temp)` called
  without disconnect first, (b) `$@` clobber — the inner cleanup
  `eval` reset `$@` so the subsequent `die "...$@"` showed the
  cleanup error instead of the original connect error. Fixed both:
  save `$connect_err = $@` first, then call
  `_disconnect_from_all_hosts` before `volume_delete`, then `die`
  with the saved error.
- **[HIGH] `_backup_vm_config()` connect-failure had the same Bug E
  pattern**: `volume_connect_host` fails → `volume_delete` without
  disconnect → orphaned host connection on the array. Fixed by
  calling `_disconnect_from_all_hosts` before `volume_delete` in
  both the connect-fail branch and the "Cannot get WWID" branch.
- **[MEDIUM] `clone_image()` was missing disk-id collision retry**
  — same TOCTOU window that `alloc_image` had before 1.1.0. Two
  concurrent `qm clone` invocations on the same source VM could
  both pick the same disk id from `_find_free_diskid` and one would
  fail with "already exists". Fixed with a 5-attempt retry loop
  around the `volume_clone` call.
- **[LOW] `rescan_scsi_device()` used `basename()` instead of
  `_resolve_block_device_name()`.** Current callers always pass
  `/dev/sdX` so the bug is latent, but as an exported helper a future
  caller passing `/dev/mapper/<wwid>` would silently fail. Fixed
  defensively for consistency with the rest of the Multipath module.
- **[LOW] `_backup_vm_config()` used bare `system()` for `mkfs.ext4`
  / `mount` / `umount`.** The 1MB volume is freshly allocated so the
  device is healthy in normal operation, but a wedged multipath
  device would cause `mount` to enter D state. Replaced all four with
  `PVE::Tools::run_command(..., timeout => 30)` and added an
  explicit `sync` before `umount`.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-04-09

### Three more bugs from a proactive sibling-pattern audit

After the four bugs in 1.1.2, the related project jt-pve-storage-netapp's maintainer ran
a proactive audit looking for other places that exhibited the same bug
patterns. Three more issues turned up. The Pure plugin had every one of
them. **Recommended over 1.1.2** — Bug E specifically can cause node
hangs through `clone_image` (or `alloc_image`) failure paths even
without the resize / rollback code paths from 1.1.2.

#### Fixed
- **[HIGH] Bug E — `alloc_image()` and `clone_image()` cleanup-on-failure
  paths called `volume_delete()` without first disconnecting the volume
  from the cluster hosts.** `_connect_to_all_hosts()` iterates every
  cluster host in per-node mode; if it succeeds on hosts 1..K and fails
  on K+1, the volume is still mapped to K hosts when the cleanup runs.
  Pure (unlike ONTAP) physically destroys a still-connected volume, but
  the orphaned host connection records cause iSCSI rescan on other
  cluster nodes to discover ghost LUNs that become stale multipath
  devices. Combined with `no_path_retry queue` in `defaults` — same
  root cause as the production hang incident that drove 1.1.0. Fixed
  by adding a `_disconnect_from_all_hosts()` helper that queries the
  array for the current connection list and disconnects each, and
  calling it BEFORE `volume_delete` in every cleanup path. Four sites
  fixed: `alloc_image()` main connect-fail cleanup, `alloc_image()`
  state/cloudinit "Cannot get WWID" cleanup, `alloc_image()` state/
  cloudinit "device did not appear" cleanup, and `clone_image()`
  connect-fail cleanup.
- **[LOW] Bug F — `volume_snapshot()` now flushes host-side dirty
  buffers before calling `snapshot_create` on the array**, mirroring
  what `volume_snapshot_rollback()` already did. For running VMs the
  qemu freeze handles consistency at the FS layer, but for offline
  volumes or external script callers (e.g. backup tools writing
  directly to a stopped-VM volume) the dirty page cache could be
  missing from the snapshot, producing a filesystem-inconsistent
  capture. Guarded by `is_device_in_use()` so we don't block on a busy
  live migration.

#### Removed
- **[LOW] Bug G + dead-export audit — four unused exported functions
  from `Multipath.pm`:** `multipath_add`, `multipath_remove`,
  `get_multipath_wwid`, `get_scsi_devices_by_serial`.
  `get_multipath_wwid` had a latent `/dev/mapper` symlink bug similar
  to the one fixed in `is_device_in_use` in 1.1.2; rather than fix
  dead code (and risk a future contributor seeing it in `@EXPORT_OK`
  and calling it), the function is removed entirely. The other three
  were also unused.

---

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-09

### CRITICAL — four post-release forensic fixes ported from related project jt-pve-storage-netapp

A customer resize incident on the NetApp plugin uncovered four bugs that
the Pure plugin **also had**. One is a silent data-loss class bug. **All
production users on 1.0.x / 1.1.0 / 1.1.1 should upgrade immediately.**

#### Fixed
- **[CRITICAL — DATA LOSS] `is_device_in_use()` always returned 0 for
  `/dev/mapper/<wwid>` paths.** It used `basename($device)` to build the
  `/sys/block/<name>/holders` path, but for a multipath device that
  resolves to `/sys/block/<wwid>/holders`, which **does not exist** —
  the holders directory lives under `/sys/block/dm-N/`. The check
  therefore reported "not in use" for any multipath device regardless of
  whether an LVM volume group, dm-crypt container, dm-raid, or any
  other holder sat on top of it. `free_image()` then proceeded to
  delete the volume — taking the customer's LVM data with it. Any
  production environment that used LVM (or dm-crypt / dm-raid / bcache /
  ...) on top of Pure-managed volumes was at risk. Fixed by adding a
  `_resolve_block_device_name()` helper that resolves
  `/dev/mapper/<wwid>` symlinks to the underlying `dm-N` name before any
  `/sys/block/` access.
- **[HIGH] `get_multipath_slaves()`** had the same broken pattern. It
  always returned an empty list for `/dev/mapper/<wwid>` paths, which
  meant `free_image()`'s post-cleanup SCSI slave removal silently
  skipped every device, leaking SCSI residue across operations.
- **[HIGH] `volume_resize()`** called `rescan_scsi_hosts()` (host scan,
  used to discover **NEW** devices) instead of per-device rescan (used
  to re-read attributes of **EXISTING** devices). After a Pure-side
  resize the array showed the new size, but the multipath device kept
  reporting the old size, and QEMU's `block_resize` then failed with
  `Cannot grow device files` on a running VM. Fixed to do per-slave
  `echo 1 > /sys/block/sdX/device/rescan` followed by
  `multipathd resize map <name>` (a new helper) to refresh the size of
  the device-mapper layer above.
- **[HIGH] `volume_snapshot_rollback()`** had the same wrong rescan as
  the resize bug, plus a second issue: even after the underlying SCSI
  paths were refreshed, the kernel buffer cache could still hold pages
  from the post-snapshot content. Subsequent reads from the rolled-back
  volume could return stale data. Fixed to (1) per-slave rescan, (2)
  `multipath_resize_map`, AND (3) `blockdev --flushbufs <device>` to
  invalidate the kernel buffer cache.

#### Added
- `_resolve_block_device_name()` helper in `Multipath.pm`. Use this
  before any `/sys/block/<name>/` access on a path that could be
  `/dev/mapper/<wwid>`. Handles `/dev/sdX`, `/dev/dm-N`, and
  `/dev/mapper/<name>` (resolves the symlink).
- `multipath_resize_map()` helper in `Multipath.pm`, exported.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-09

### Multipath / anti-hang follow-ups

Discovered while reviewing v1.1.0 against the PVE storage plugin
development guide. **Recommended over 1.1.0** — 1.1.0 had the cluster
cleanup architecture but the multipath device template was still missing
`no_path_retry`, which meant a stale device on a host with
`no_path_retry queue` in `defaults` would still hang. This release closes
that gap.

#### Fixed
- **Pure multipath device template now sets `no_path_retry 30` and
  `fast_io_fail_tmo 5` explicitly.** Without these the per-device block
  inherited the `defaults` section value, which on many sites is `queue`
  (the historical NetApp HA recommendation). Combined with a stale Pure
  device this caused `sync` / `blockdev` / `multipath -f` to enter
  uninterruptible sleep — exactly what 1.1.0 was trying to prevent.
- **`_ensure_multipath_config` now version-marks the file it generates**
  (`# pure-multipath-config-version: 2`) and rewrites plugin-managed
  files when the marker version changes. Files **without** the marker are
  still left untouched (operator-edited or third-party). This means a
  1.0.x → 1.1.x upgrade actually picks up the new safety settings instead
  of silently keeping the old file forever.
  > **⚠️ Upgrade gotcha:** if your existing
  > `/etc/multipath/conf.d/pure-storage.conf` was created by an earlier
  > plugin version (1.0.x), it has NO marker line, so 1.1.x will leave
  > it alone. You must either manually align it with the new device
  > block (see README "Upgrade SOP" → callout box) or `rm` the file to
  > let the plugin recreate it. Otherwise the new `no_path_retry 30`
  > / `fast_io_fail_tmo 5` safety settings will not be in effect.
- Replace bare `system('fuser', ...)` in `is_device_in_use` with a
  timeout-bounded `_run_cmd` (5s). `fuser` opens the device path; on a
  wedged multipath device with `queue_if_no_path` it can itself enter D
  state and never return.
- Replace bare `system('sync')` and `system('blockdev', ...)` in
  `volume_resize` with `PVE::Tools::run_command(..., timeout => 10)`.
- Add `_udev_refresh()` helper that calls `udevadm trigger` and
  `udevadm settle` via `PVE::Tools::run_command` with a 10s timeout, and
  replace all 13 bare `system('udevadm ...')` calls in the plugin and
  the Multipath module with the helper.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-09

### Major reliability release — port the v0.2.x lessons-learned fixes from the related project jt-pve-storage-netapp

Validated by a real production incident where stale multipath devices
combined with `queue_if_no_path` put PVE daemons into uninterruptible
sleep requiring a node reboot.

#### Anti-hang protections (Section 1)
- Add `sysfs_write_with_timeout` / `sysfs_read_with_timeout` helpers in
  `Multipath.pm`. All direct writes to `/sys/class/scsi_host/*/scan`,
  `/sys/class/block/*/device/{delete,rescan}` and reads from
  `/proc/mounts` and `/sys/.../wwid` now go through forked
  timeout-bounded children so an unresponsive HBA cannot put the parent
  process into D state.
- Replace bare `system('sync')` / `system('blockdev')` in cleanup paths
  with timeout-bounded `_run_cmd` calls.
- `cleanup_lun_devices` now disables `queue_if_no_path` with `multipathd`
  and issues `dmsetup message ... fail_if_no_path` BEFORE attempting
  `sync` / `blockdev` / `multipath -f`. Otherwise queueing causes those
  operations to hang forever on a dead device.
- `multipath_flush` now refuses to run without a device argument (it
  used to fall through to `multipath -F` which flushes ALL maps
  system-wide and can disconnect customer-managed non-Pure storage).
- `multipath_flush` has a built-in `dmsetup --force` fallback if
  `multipath -f <wwid>` fails or times out.

#### Cluster safety (Section 2)
- Add `is_portal_logged_in()` in `ISCSI.pm` and use it from
  `login_target` and `activate_storage`. Pure controllers share one IQN
  across multiple LIFs; checking by target only made the second-and-later
  portal logins silently no-op, leaving the host with one path instead
  of N.
- `login_target` now sets `node.session.timeo.replacement_timeout` to
  120 so transient outages and Pure controller failovers recover
  cleanly regardless of `iscsid.conf` state.
- `activate_storage` skips `iscsiadm discovery+login` for
  already-connected portals (saves up to 30s discovery latency on every
  status poll).

#### `free_image` operation order (Section 3)
- Capture multipath slave device list **before** unmap (after unmap the
  `/sys/block/.../slaves` directory disappears).
- Disconnect from ALL hosts FIRST, then clean local devices, then delete
  the volume on the array. The previous order allowed an in-flight
  iSCSI rescan from another node to re-import the LUN and recreate the
  multipath device behind us.
- After `cleanup_lun_devices`, also remove residual SCSI slave devices
  using the captured list and reload `multipathd` to settle state.

#### API resilience (Section 4)
- Default UA timeout reduced from 30s to 15s and retry count from 3 to
  2 (worst case ~34s instead of ~102s).
- `_request` now accepts a per-call `timeout` option that overrides the
  UA timeout for that single call and is restored on every exit path.
- `volume_delete` uses a 60s per-call timeout because Pure volume
  destroy can be slow when the volume has many snapshots.
- 401 retry now also re-applies any per-call timeout override after
  `_create_session` may have rebuilt the LWP::UserAgent.
- `status()` now fail-fasts on API errors (returns inactive zeros)
  instead of letting the polling thread block.
- `status()` now runs orphan / temp-clone cleanup in a double-forked
  grandchild that gets reparented to init, so cleanup never blocks the
  storage daemon.

#### Cluster residual / orphan cleanup (Section 5)
- Add WWID tracking infrastructure: per-storage state file at
  `/var/lib/pve-storage-purestorage/<storeid>-wwids.json` with
  file-locking via
  `/var/run/pve-storage-purestorage/<storeid>-wwids.lock`. Lock
  acquisition uses non-blocking `flock` with bounded retries (10s
  deadline) to avoid blocking forever on a stuck worker.
- `path()` tracks the WWID after successfully resolving a real device.
- `free_image` conditionally untracks the WWID only after confirming
  the local multipath device is gone — if cleanup left a stale device,
  the WWID stays tracked so the next orphan cleanup pass can retry.
- `_cleanup_orphaned_devices` runs in three phases:
  1. **Auto-import**: every current Pure-managed LUN WWID from the array
     is added to local tracking (so all cluster nodes converge on the
     same alive set).
  2. **Cleanup**: for each tracked WWID not on the array, clean its
     local stale device if any.
  3. **Warn**: list Pure multipath devices not in tracking and not on
     the array (do **not** auto-clean — could be customer-managed).

#### postinst (Section 6)
- Print a "CRITICAL Multipath Safety Rules" banner explaining
  `multipath -F` vs `multipath -f`, restart vs reload, and the
  recommended Pure-friendly multipath.conf settings.
- Detect dangerous `/etc/multipath.conf` settings (`no_path_retry queue`,
  `queue_if_no_path`, `dev_loss_tmo infinity`) and warn without
  auto-modifying the customer's config.
- Detect existing stale Pure multipath devices on upgrade and list the
  exact manual cleanup commands.
- Pre-create `/var/lib/pve-storage-purestorage` and
  `/var/run/pve-storage-purestorage` with mode 0700.

#### Code quality (Section 7)
- `alloc_image` now retries on disk-id collision (TOCTOU between
  `_find_free_diskid` and `volume_create` when two workers race).
- `path()` now has a proper retry loop bounded by `pure-device-timeout`
  (default 30s) instead of a one-shot rescan.
- `list_images` template-detection fallback now has a 10s wall-clock
  deadline so a slow array does not cascade timeouts across hundreds of
  volumes.

#### Documentation (Section 8)
- README.md and README_zh-TW.md gain prominent **CRITICAL: Multipath
  Safety Rules** and **Upgrade SOP** sections near the top.
- New `docs/TESTING.md` and `docs/TESTING_zh-TW.md`: Pure-Storage-specific
  test plan covering basic connectivity, VM lifecycle, hot-plug,
  snapshot/clone, cluster orphan cleanup, mixed-environment safety,
  failure injection (controller failover, blocked LIFs, blocked API,
  `queue_if_no_path` + stale device hang), API 1.x and 2.x coverage,
  naming edge cases, pod (ActiveCluster) mode, per-node vs shared host
  mode, performance/sanity, and upgrade path.

## [1.0.49] - 2026-02-27

### Second-round audit fixes for reliability and correctness

- Fix `volume_snapshot_list` double-encoding `pve-snap-` prefix, which
  caused `snapshot_delete` to fail on re-encoded names.
- Fix `list_images` passing pod-prefixed name to `pure_to_pve_volname`,
  causing decode failure for cloudinit / state volumes in pod setups.
- Fix `parse_volname` returning undef instead of die (violates PVE
  storage plugin API contract, causes silent failures).
- Fix `pve-pure-config-get` LXC detection operator precedence that
  misidentified QEMU VMs with an `arch:` line as LXC containers.
- Fix `pve-pure-config-get` `umount` calls to use list-form `system()`
  to prevent shell injection.
- Fix `_backup_vm_config` missing `cleanup_lun_devices` on error paths,
  leaving stale SCSI devices after failed backup.
- Fix API cache fork-safety with PID check to prevent stale session
  tokens in forked PVE daemon workers.
- Fix `deactivate_storage` to check `is_device_in_use` before
  disconnect, preventing cleanup of volumes still in use by other VMs.
- Fix `alloc_image` orphan cleanup missing `skip_eradicate`, which
  could permanently eradicate volumes on allocation retry.
- Replace ad-hoc `multipathd reconfigure` shell calls with
  `multipath_reload()` for consistency.
- Fix `SG_INVERT` typo to `SG_INQ` in `Multipath.pm`.
- Fix config volume name length check in `encode_config_volume_name`
  to truncate `snapname` when total exceeds 63 chars.
- Move `IO::Select` imports to file-level in `ISCSI.pm` and
  `Multipath.pm`.
- Fix `pve-pure-config-get` restore mode cleanup on config write error
  (`umount` and `disconnect` now always run).
- Remove dead code in `pve-pure-config-get` restore mode.

## [1.0.48] - 2026-02-12

### Security and reliability audit fixes across all modules

- Fix `path()` returning `/dev/null` or synthetic path on API failure,
  now properly dies to prevent silent data corruption (CRITICAL).
- Fix `get_multipath_device` using substring WWID match that could
  return wrong device, now uses exact match only (HIGH).
- Fix `get_device_by_wwid` glob patterns to use exact suffix match
  instead of substring to prevent device collision (HIGH).
- Fix ISCSI `_find_multipath_device` and `wait_for_device` to use exact
  serial suffix matching instead of substring (HIGH).
- Fix `_cleanup_orphaned_temp_clones` ISO 8601 timestamp parsing for
  API 2.x (was comparing string to epoch, never cleaning up).
- Fix `clone_image` disk ID allocation race by using `_find_free_diskid`
  instead of manual `max+1` logic.
- Fix `_find_free_diskid` to strip pod prefix before
  `decode_volume_name`.
- Fix `pve-pure-config-get` restore mode boolean logic that always
  errored in restore mode.
- Fix `pve-pure-config-get` `san_storage` to use `sanitize_for_pure`.
- Fix shell injection in `is_device_in_use` `fuser` call and
  `_backup_vm_config` system calls (use list form).
- Fix `_backup_vm_config` mount cleanup on error path.
- Add in-use guard to `cleanup_lun_devices` to prevent cleaning devices
  that are still mounted or held open.
- Fix `_run_cmd` in `ISCSI.pm` and `Multipath.pm` to use `IO::Select`
  for simultaneous stdout / stderr reading (prevents deadlock).
- Fix `_run_cmd` timeout to kill child process (prevents orphans).
